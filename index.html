            <img src="./assets/map.jpg" alt="Map of Gathering of Israel" class="right-img">
            <p>The Gathering of Israel is one of the most profound doctrines restored in the early days of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This doctrine revolves around the gathering of the descendants of Israel—both spiritually and physically—as part of the preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <img src="./assets/temple.jpg" alt="Missionaries gathering Saints" class="right-img">
            <p>From the earliest days of the Restoration, Joseph Smith taught that the gathering of Israel was central to the mission of the Church. Missionary efforts, the gathering of Saints to Nauvoo, and the subsequent trek to the Salt Lake Valley were all seen as part of this divine mandate.</p>
