                <b>The Great Apostasy</b> refers to the period of spiritual darkness and loss of the divine authorite that happened right after the death of Jesus Christ's original Apostles. This concept is foundational to the teachings of the LDS Church, and provides the historical explanation for the need for the Restoration of the Gospel.

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <img src="./assets/jc.jpg" alt="Missionaries gathering Saints" class="right-img">
            <p>The term "apostasy" derives from the Greek word <i>apostasia</i>, which means "to deflect" or "revolt".  </p>
            <p>
                Following Christ's ministry and atoning sacrifice, his apostles were tasked with leading his church and spreading his word and his teachings. 
                However, after their deaths, the church experienced a pretty significant doctrinal corruption, resulting in loss of priesthood authority, and fragmentation.
                This marked the beginning of what is often referred to as the Great Apostacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The New Testament provides evidence of the challenges and problems the early church ran into after the death of Christ. Apostles like Paul warned us againts
                the false teachings and apostasy. In 2 Thessalonians 2:3, Paul wrote:
                <i>
                 "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition."   
                </i>
                This "falling away" was interpreted by the Latter-day Saints as a prophecy of the Great Apostacy.

        <section id="loss-of-priesthood-authority">
            <h2>Loss of Priesthood Authority</h2>
           <p>
               A concept that is central to our understanding of the Great Apostasy is priesthood authority - the power to act in God's name.
               During Christ's eartly ministry, he bestowed this authority upon his apostles. However, after their deaths, the priesthood was no longer present on Earth.
               While church that he established functioned as as an institution, it lacked the authority to perform saving ordinances like baptisms and the laying of the hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

           </p>>
           <p>
                The absence of priesthood authority cause a significant changes to the doctrine 
                and church practices. Key ordinances and teachings were changed or abandoned, leading to
                a lot of discrepancy from the original church established by Christ.

            <h2>Doctrinal Corruption</h2>
            <img src="./assets/great-apostasy.jpg" alt="Sheep" class="right-img">
            <p>Over time, early Christianity became increasingly influenced by the philosophies of men and politics. As church leaders sought to align what they did with political powers (such as the Roman Empire), theological debates led to the creation of what we now call "mainstream Christianity".</p>
            <p>
                One of the most significant events was the <b>Council of Nicaea</b> in 325 AD.
                Led by Emperor Constantine, the council sought to resolve some disputes about the nature of Christ
                and his relationship to God and the Holy Spirit. While it succeeded in creating a unified doctrine for people,
                it can also be seen as the evidence of human intervention into the doctrine.
            </p>
            <p> In addition to the human intervention into the doctrine, practices such as 
                infant baptisms, veneration of saints, celibacy of clergy and other new practices marked a 
                departure from original teachings of Jesus Christ.

            <h2>Events and Locations of the Great Apostasy</h2>
            <p>The Great Apostasy was not just a single event, but rather a gradual process. Key locations and events include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Martyrdom of the Apostles:</h3>
                    <p>The deaths of Peter, Paul, and other Apostles during the 
                        1st century left the Church without divinely appointed leaders.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Constantine’s Adoption of Christianity:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Edict of Milan (313 AD) legalized Christianity,
                         but the blending of Roman practices 
                         with Christian traditions led to further doctrinal changes.

                    <p>
                        In 1054 AD, the Christian Church split into the Roman Catholic 
                        and Eastern Orthodox traditions. This division further worsened 
                        the fragmentation within Christianity.

            <h2>Scriptural Connections</h2>
       <p>
        In addition to Paul's writings, other scripture teachings support 
        the Great Apostasy. For example, 
        Amos 8:11-12 says:
       </p>
       <i>
        "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it."

            <h2>Restoration Through the Prophet Joseph Smith</h2>
       <p>
        The Great Apostasy set the stage for the Restoration
         of the Gospel through the prophet Joseph Smith. In 1820, 
         during the First Vision, 
         Joseph Smith was visited by God the Father 
         and Jesus Christ, who informed him that the 
         fullness of the Gospel was not present on the earth.
       </p>
     
       <p>
        In subsequent years, heavenly messengers,
         including John the Baptist and Peter, James, 
         and John, restored the priesthood authority.
          This restoration marked the end of the Great
           Apostasy and the beginning of the dispensation 
           of the fullness of times.

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
       <p>
        The Great Apostasy is a pivotal doctrine that
        explains the loss of priesthood authority, 
        the doctrinal corruption of early Christianity,
        and the fragmentation of Christ’s original church. 
        Its impact was profound, creating a spiritual void 
        that could only be filled through divine intervention.
        The Restoration of the Gospel, as taught by the LDS chrch, is the fulfillment
         of ancient prophecies and a 
        testament to God’s continuous involvement in the salvation 
        of his children.
