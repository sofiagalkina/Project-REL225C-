            <img src="./assets/map.jpg" alt="Map of Gathering of Israel" class="right-img">
            <p>The Gathering of Israel is one of the most profound doctrines restored in the early days of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This doctrine revolves around the gathering of the descendants of Israel—both spiritually and physically—as part of the preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><b>The Old Testament</b> tells us that the children of Israel will one day be gathered again. Joseph Smith and the early Latter-day Saints lived in the time in which the promised gathering would begin. The Saints were also ti build a <b>"city of Zion"</b> to which converts to the Church could gather in preparation for the Second Coming. Within just a few months of the organization of the Church, Joseph Smith received a revelation instructing the newly baptized members to leave their homes and gather "in unto one place upon the face of this land." Ohio was the first place designated for gathering. Next revelation to Joseph Smith identified Jackson County, Missouri as the place to begin building the city of Zion. Unfortunately, the Saints were expelled from the county in 1833, three years after establishing of the Church, preventing them from building the city. The Saints continued to establish settlements in surrounding counties.
            Thankfully, in April 1836 prophet Moses from the Old Testament appeared to Joseph, giving him the "keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the Land of the North.”
        Soon thereafter, new apostles were called to England to establish the Church's very first mission overseas. Thousands and thousands of converts started relocating to the United States, populating Saints' stakes in Ohio, Missouri, and later, Illinois. 
    In Nauvoo, Illinois, the Saints established a large stake and began building a new temple. Joseph Smith taught that in one sense, "the whole America is Zion," and the Saints could gather anywhere so long as there was a temple. </p>

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <img src="./assets/temple.jpg" alt="Missionaries gathering Saints" class="right-img">
            <p>From the earliest days of the Restoration, Joseph Smith taught that the gathering of Israel was central to the mission of the Church. Missionary efforts, the gathering of Saints to Nauvoo, and the subsequent trek to the Salt Lake Valley were all seen as part of this divine mandate.</p>
            <p>
               After Joseph's death, the Saints migrated to American West, where they continues to establish stakes of Zion and build temples. 
               New members from abroad were encouraged to to emigrate as fast as possible to the "Great Basin". However, the Church leaders in 1890s began to encourage new members to remain in their homelands. In 1894, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve decided that members who resided far from Utah should not be encouraged to emigrate and those who are already well employed and stable financially shouldn't emigrate to Utah "where labor is so scarce." But the earlier directive to gather to Zion continued to appeal to some members, and leaders felt they could not in good conscience discourage members from migrating if they desired and had the means to do so.
               In 1952, President David O. McKay traveled to Europe and told to a reporter that the Church aims "to keep our adherents here instead of encouraging them to immigrate to Utah and other places in the United States." Subsequent Presidents of the Church continued to pursue the goal of building temples wherever there were large concentrations of Saints.
               Elder McConkie taught that every stake on earth is the gathering place "for the lost sheep of Israel who live in its area." Establishing of temples and stakes throughout the world has provided Latter-day Saints with the advantage and blessing of gathering and continuance of gathering God's children in their own lands.
